### **OverView**
This repo is intended to display samples of my coding work both from school projects as well as additional practice/projects I am able to create outside of my curriculum
The programs/code showcased here are **not** intended to be downloaded and run, rather offer some idea of my coding style and experiences

### **Disclaimer**
Most of the school work showcased here was partially constructed/worked on by my Instructors and/or classmates (in the case of a group project)
However, the main functionality/implementation was completed by me in most cases and is intended to exhibit my capabilities only
